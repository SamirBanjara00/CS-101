4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz)
      Approach: Starting off this problem was very hard for me. Since we were not using command line arguments.
      I was extremely confused as I don't think we had gone over how to do it. I actually stumbled upon the answer by l
      looking back at the transpose.py to initialize the 2d array. So line 6 create a 2d array with 11 rows, and
      16 columns. Then line 7 goes through 0 to 11 rows then we loop if for the columns using another for loop.
      line 10 stores what ever is read using stdio.ReadInt() in [i][j]. So it stores the row and column 1, the row 0 and
      column 1. Same applies for trio, just different variables. Now we have to roll die. We have 16 trials of die roll,
      so we use a for function which has 2 random die rolls. Then we out up the row x column where row is the sum of
      two die rolls. Same applies for trio.

      Issues and resolution: ...

   Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz)
      Approach: Need to create list first, and make the list read the input provided by the generatewaltz.py file. I used
      read all intf function to read all the integer of the generate file and placed 32 integers into the list. After
      creating the list we need to ensure they meet our bounds and generate error messages according to the instruction
      line 8 checks the integer i which is the length of the # of integers in list waltz. If it is less than 1 or
      greater than 32 it will display message. For line 12, i didnt use len(waltz) because we can check if the
      integers is between bounds, not the number of integers. line 16 sets bound to use if function for the integer
      position in list between 15 and 31, because that is where the trio numbers start. We need to play the  sounds now.
      So i used line 20,a for function, to play only trio numbers and only play minuet numbers. line 21 find the integer
      position in list below 16, and line 24 finishes playing for integer in list above 15.

      Issues and resolution: I had a hard time recalling the position of where minut ended adn trio ended to check if
      they were between bound of 1 and 96. I had used 4 diffrent types of for loop to check if i within the 16 position
      31st position in last waltz was between 1 and 96. For all I did was constraint the entire list to the bound of 1
      and 96, so it would display the trio message. I finally used range within the list position of 16 and 32. I had
      used waltz[16] and waltz[32] but i realized the list starts at 0. So I did 15 and 31. I had also only called the
      play function 1 time for trio so, i was only getting half the sound. I shifted my play function within the for
      loop and played it for both minuet and trio. I also had not used sys.exit as i dont think we went over it class.
      I had to post a question on piazza for help.
